.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
gcloud\ components\ update [\fICOMPONENT\-IDS\fR\ \&...] [\fB\-\-format\fR\ \fIFORMAT\fR] [\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-project\fR\ \fIPROJECT_ID\fR] [\fB\-\-quiet\fR,\ \fB\-q\fR] [\fB\-h\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Ensure that the latest version of each specified component, and the latest version of all components upon which the specified components directly or indirectly depend, is installed on the local workstation\&. If the command includes one or more names of components or packages, the specified components are the named components and the components contained in the named packages; if the command does not name any components or packages, the specified components are all installed components\&.
.sp
The items may be individual components or preconfigured packages\&. If a downloaded component was not previously installed, the downloaded version is installed\&. If an earlier version of the component was previously installed, that version is replaced by the downloaded version\&.
.sp
If, for example, the component \fIUNICORN\-FACTORY\fR depends on the component \fIHORN\-FACTORY\fR, installing the latest version of \fIUNICORN\-FACTORY\fR will cause the version of \fIHORN\-FACTORY\fR upon which it depends to be installed as well, if it is not already installed\&. The command lists all components it is about to install, and asks for confirmation before proceeding\&.
