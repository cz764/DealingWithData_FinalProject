.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute target\-pools create\fR is used to create a target pool\&. A target pool resource defines a group of instances that can receive incoming traffic from forwarding rules\&. When a forwarding rule directs traffic to a target pool, Google Compute Engine picks an instance from the target pool based on a hash of the source and destination IP addresses and ports\&. For more information on load balancing, see https://developers\&.google\&.com/compute/docs/load\-balancing/\&.
.sp
To add instances to a target pool, use \fIgcloud compute target\-pools add\-instances\fR\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fINAME\fR
.RS 4
The name of the target pool\&.
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-backup\-pool\fR \fIBACKUP_POOL\fR
.RS 4
Together with
\fI\-\-failover\-ratio\fR, this flag defines the fallback behavior of the target pool (primary pool) to be created by this command\&. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below the specified
_\-\-failover\-ratio value_, then traffic arriving at the load\-balanced IP address will be directed to the backup pool\&. If this flag is provided, then
\fI\-\-failover\-ratio\fR
is required\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 4
An optional description of this target pool\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-failover\-ratio\fR \fIFAILOVER_RATIO\fR
.RS 4
Together with
\fI\-\-backup\-pool\fR, defines the fallback behavior of the target pool (primary pool) to be created by this command\&. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load\-balanced IP address will be directed to the backup pool\&. For example, if 0\&.4 is chosen as the failover ratio, then traffic will fail over to the backup pool if more than 40% of the instances become unhealthy\&. If not set, the traffic will be directed the instances in this pool in the
\fIforce\fR
mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no instance is healthy\&. If this flag is provided, then
\fI\-\-backup\-pool\fR
is required\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-health\-check\fR \fIHEALTH_CHECK\fR
.RS 4
Specifies an HTTP health check resource to use to determine the health of instances in this pool\&. If no health check is specified, traffic will be sent to all instances in this target pool as if the instances were healthy, but the health status of this pool will appear as unhealthy as a warning that this target pool does not have a health check\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-region\fR \fIREGION\fR
.RS 4
The region of the target pool to create\&. If not specified, you will be prompted to select a region\&.
.sp
To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\fIcompute/region\fR
property:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A list of regions can fetched by running:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud compute regions list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To unset the property, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud config unset compute/region
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-session\-affinity\fR \fISESSION_AFFINITY\fR; default="NONE"
.RS 4
Specifies the session affinity option for the connection\&. If
\fINONE\fR
is selected, then connections from the same client IP address may go to any instance in the target pool\&. If
\fICLIENT_IP\fR
is selected, then connections from the same client IP address will go to the same instance in the target pool\&. If
\fICLIENT_IP_PROTO\fR
is selected, then connections from the same client IP with the same IP protocol will go to the same client pool\&. If not specified, then
\fINONE\fR
is used as a default\&.
.RE
.SS "GLOBAL FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-format\fR \fIFORMAT\fR
.RS 4
Specify a format for printed output\&. By default, a command\-specific human\-friendly output format is used\&. Setting this flag to one of the available options will serialize the result of the command in the chosen format and print it to stdout\&. Supported formats are:
json,
text,
yaml\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display detailed help\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-project\fR \fIPROJECT_ID\fR
.RS 4
The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation\&. If omitted then the current project is assumed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR
.RS 4
Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands\&. If input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR
.RS 4
Print a summary help and exit\&.
.RE
.SH "NOTES"

This command is in the Google Cloud SDK \fBcompute\fR component\&. See installing components if it is not installed\&.
