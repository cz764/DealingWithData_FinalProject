SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         --url-map URL_MAP [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-http-proxies create is used to create target HTTP
      proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by one or more forwarding rules
      which define which packets the proxy is responsible for routing. The
      target HTTP proxy points to a URL map that defines the rules for routing
      the requests. The URL map's job is to map URLs to backend services which
      handle the actual requests.
