NAME

      gcloud compute instances stop - stop a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances stop NAME [NAME ...] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances stop is used stop a Google Compute Engine virtual
      machine. Stopping a VM performs a clean shutdown, much like invoking the
      shutdown functionality of a workstation or laptop. Stopping an
      SSD-attached VM is not supported and will result in an API error.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The names of the instances to stop.

FLAGS

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to stop. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
