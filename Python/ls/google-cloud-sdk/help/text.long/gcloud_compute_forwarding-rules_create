DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules create is used to create a forwarding
      rule. Forwarding rules match and direct certain types of traffic to a load
      balancer which is controlled by a target pool, a target instance, or a
      target HTTP proxy. Target pools and target instances perform load
      balancing at the layer 3 of the OSI networking model
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). Target HTTP proxies perform
      load balancing at layer 7.

      Forwarding rules can be either regional or global. They are regional if
      they point to a target pool or a target instance and global if they point
      to a target HTTP proxy.

      For more information on load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

      When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of --target-instance
      --target-pool, and --target-http-proxy must be specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the forwarding rule.

FLAGS

      --address ADDRESS

         The external IP address that the forwarding rule will serve. All
         traffic sent to this IP address is directed to the target pointed to by
         the forwarding rule. If the address is reserved, it must either (1)
         reside in the global scope if the forwarding rule is being configured
         to point to a target HTTP proxy or (2) reside in the same region as the
         forwarding rule if the forwarding rule is being configured to point to
         a target pool or target instance. If this flag is omitted, an ephemeral
         IP address is assigned.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional textual description for the forwarding rule.

      --global

         If provided, assume the forwarding rules are global. A forwarding rule
         is global if it references a target HTTP proxy.

      --ip-protocol IP_PROTOCOL

         The IP protocol that the rule will serve. If left empty, TCP is used.
         Supported protocols are: AH, ESP, SCTP, TCP, UDP.

      --port-range [PORT | PORT-PORT]

         If specified, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range
         will be forwarded. If not specified for regional forwarding rules, all
         ports are matched. This flag is required for global forwarding rules.

      --region REGION

         The region of the forwarding rule to operate on. If not specified, you
         will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

      --target-http-proxy TARGET_HTTP_PROXY

         The target HTTP proxy that will receive the traffic.

      --target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE

         The name of the target instance that will receive the traffic. The
         target instance must be in a zone that's in the forwarding rule's
         region. Global forwarding rules may not direct traffic to target
         instances. If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

      --target-instance-zone TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE

         The zone of the target instance.

      --target-pool TARGET_POOL

         The target pool that will receive the traffic. The target pool must be
         in the same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding rules may
         not direct traffic to target pools.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
