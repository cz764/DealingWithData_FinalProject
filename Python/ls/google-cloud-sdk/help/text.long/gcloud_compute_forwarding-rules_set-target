NAME

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules set-target - modify a forwarding rule to
         direct network traffic to a new target

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules set-target NAME [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--global | --region REGION]
         [--target-http-proxy TARGET_HTTP_PROXY |
          --target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE | --target-pool TARGET_POOL]
         [--target-instance-zone TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute forwarding-rules set-target is used to set a new target for
      a forwarding rule. Forwarding rules match and direct certain types of
      traffic to a load balancer which is controlled by a target pool, a target
      instance, or a target HTTP proxy. Target pools and target instances
      perform load balancing at the layer 3 of the OSI networking model
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer). Target HTTP proxies perform
      load balancing at layer 7.

      Forwarding rules can be either regional or global. They are regional if
      they point to a target pool or a target instance and global if they point
      to a target HTTP proxy.

      For more information on load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

      When modifying a forwarding rule, exactly one of --target-instance
      --target-pool, and --target-http-proxy must be specified.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the forwarding rule.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, assume the forwarding rules are global. A forwarding rule
         is global if it references a target HTTP proxy.

      --region REGION

         The region of the forwarding rule to operate on. If not specified, you
         will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

      --target-http-proxy TARGET_HTTP_PROXY

         The target HTTP proxy that will receive the traffic.

      --target-instance TARGET_INSTANCE

         The name of the target instance that will receive the traffic. The
         target instance must be in a zone that's in the forwarding rule's
         region. Global forwarding rules may not direct traffic to target
         instances. If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

      --target-instance-zone TARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE

         The zone of the target instance.

      --target-pool TARGET_POOL

         The target pool that will receive the traffic. The target pool must be
         in the same region as the forwarding rule. Global forwarding rules may
         not direct traffic to target pools.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
