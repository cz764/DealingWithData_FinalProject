NAME

      gcloud compute project-info add-metadata - add or update project-wide
         metadata

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute project-info add-metadata [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--metadata KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]]
         [--metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH [KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH ...]]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute project-info add-metadata can be used to add or update
      project-wide metadata. Every instance has access to a metadata server that
      can be used to query metadata that has been set through this tool.
      Project-wide metadata entries are visible to all instances. To set
      metadata for individual instances, use 'gcloud compute instances
      add-metadata'. For information on metadata, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/metadata.

      Only metadata keys that are provided are mutated. Existing metadata
      entries will remain unaffected.

FLAGS

      --metadata KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]

         Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
         the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
         equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in
         length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes in length.
         Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
         key-1=value-1 key-2=value-2 key-3=value-3.

         In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, the
         following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script

            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url

            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

      --metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH [KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH ...]

         Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
         from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
         startup-script contents.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
