NAME

      gcloud compute networks create - create a Google Compute Engine network

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute networks create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--range RANGE; default="10.240.0.0/16"] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute networks create is used to create virtual networks. A
      network performs the same function that a router does in a home network:
      it describes the network range and gateway IP address, handles
      communication between instances, and serves as a gateway between instances
      and callers outside the network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the network.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the network.

      --range RANGE; default="10.240.0.0/16"

         Specifies the IPv4 address range of this network. The range must be
         specified in CIDR format:
         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing. If
         omitted, 10.240.0.0/16 is used.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
