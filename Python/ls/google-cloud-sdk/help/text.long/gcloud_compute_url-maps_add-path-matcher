DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher is used to add a path matcher to
      a URL map. A path matcher maps HTTP request paths to backend services.
      Each path matcher must be referenced by at least one host rule. This
      command can create a new host rule through the --new-hosts flag or it can
      reconfigure an existing host rule to point to the newly added path matcher
      using --existing-host. In the latter case, if a path matcher is orphaned
      as a result of the operation, this command will fail unless
      --delete-orphaned-path-matcher is provided.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the URL map.

FLAGS

      --default-service DEFAULT_SERVICE

         A backend service that will be used for requests that the path matcher
         cannot match.

      --delete-orphaned-path-matcher

         If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this command,
         the command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of failing.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the path matcher.

      --existing-host EXISTING_HOST

         An existing host rule to tie the new path matcher to. Although host
         rules can contain more than one host, only a single host is needed to
         uniquely identify the host rule.

      --new-hosts NEW_HOST [NEW_HOST ...]

         If specified, a new host rule with the given hosts is createdand the
         path matcher is tied to the new host rule.

      --path-matcher-name PATH_MATCHER_NAME

         The name to assign to the path matcher.

      --path-rules PATH=SERVICE [PATH=SERVICE ...]

         Rules for mapping request paths to services.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To create a rule for mapping the paths /search and /search/* to the
      hypothetical search-service and /images/* to the images-service under the
      hosts google.com and *.google.com, run:

        $ gcloud compute url-maps add-path-matcher MY-URL-MAP \
            --path-matcher-name MY-MATCHER \
            --default-service MY-DEFAULT-SERVICE \
            --path-rules /search=search-service /search/*=search_service \
            /images/*=images-service --new-hosts google.com "*.google.com"

      Note that a default service must be provided to handle paths for which
      there is no mapping.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
