NAME

      gcloud compute url-maps create - create a URL map

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute url-maps create NAME --default-service DEFAULT_SERVICE
         [--description DESCRIPTION] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute url-maps create is used to create URL maps which map HTTP
      and HTTPS request URLs to backend services. Mappings are done using a
      longest-match strategy.

      There are two components to a mapping: a host rule and a path matcher. A
      host rule maps one or more hosts to a path matcher. A path matcher maps
      request paths to backend services. For example, a host rule can map the
      hosts *.google.com and google.com to a path matcher called www. The www
      path matcher in turn can map the path /search/* to the search backend
      service and everything else to a default backend service.

      Host rules and patch matchers can be added to the URL map after the map is
      created by using 'gcloud compute url-maps edit' or by using 'gcloud
      compute url-maps add-path-matcher' and 'gcloud compute url-maps
      add-host-rule'.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the URL map.

FLAGS

      --default-service DEFAULT_SERVICE

         A backend service that will be used for requests for which this URL map
         has no mappings.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the URL map.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
