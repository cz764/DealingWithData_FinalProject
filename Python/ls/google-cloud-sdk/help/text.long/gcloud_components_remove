NAME

      gcloud components remove - remove one or more installed components

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components remove COMPONENT-ID [COMPONENT-ID ...] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      Uninstall all listed components, as well as all components that directly
      or indirectly depend on them. For example, if the component
      unicorn-factory depends on the component horn-factory, removing
      horn-factory will cause unicorn-factory to be removed as well. The command
      lists all components it is about to remove, and asks for confirmation
      before proceeding.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      COMPONENT-ID [COMPONENT-ID ...]

         The IDs of the components to be removed.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To remove COMPONENT-1, COMPONENT-2, and all components that directly or
      indirectly depend on COMPONENT-1 or COMPONENT-2, type the following:

        $ gcloud components remove COMPONENT-1 COMPONENT-2

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
