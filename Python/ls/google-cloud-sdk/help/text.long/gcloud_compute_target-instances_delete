NAME

      gcloud compute target-instances delete - delete target instances

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-instances delete NAME [NAME ...] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-instances delete deletes one or more Google Compute
      Engine target instances. Target instances can be deleted only if they are
      not being used by any other resources like forwarding rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME [NAME ...]

         The resources to delete.

FLAGS

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the resources to delete. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
