      gcloud compute instances set-scheduling - set scheduling options for
         Google Compute Engine virtual machines

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances set-scheduling INSTANCE [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--no-restart-on-failure |
          --restart-on-failure] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      $gcloud compute instances set-scheduling is used to configure scheduling
      options for Google Compute Engine virtual machines.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         The name of the instance for which to change scheduling options.

FLAGS

      --maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY

         Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
         undergo maintenance. TERMINATE indicates that the instances should be
         terminated. MIGRATE indicates that the instances should be migrated to
         a new host. Choosing MIGRATE will temporarily impact the performance of
         instances during a migration event.

      --no-restart-on-failure

         If provided, the instances will not be restarted automatically if they
         are terminated by the system. Mutually exclusive with
         --restart-on-failure. This does not affect terminations performed by
         the user.

      --restart-on-failure

         If provided, the instances will be restarted automatically if they are
         terminated by the system. This flag is mutually exclusive with
         --no-restart-on-failure. This does not affect terminations performed by
         the user.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to set scheduling settings for. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
