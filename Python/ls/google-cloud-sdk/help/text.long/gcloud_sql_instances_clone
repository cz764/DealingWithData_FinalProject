NAME

      gcloud sql instances clone - clones a Cloud SQL instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud sql instances clone SOURCE DESTINATION [--async]
         [--bin-log-file-name BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME]
         [--bin-log-position BIN_LOG_POSITION] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      Creates a clone of the Cloud SQL instance. The source and the destination
      instances must be in the same project. The clone once created will be an
      independent Cloud SQL instance.

      The binary log coordinates, if specified, act as the point up to which the
      source instance is cloned. If not specified, the source instance is cloned
      up to the most recent binary log coordintes at the time the command is
      executed.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      SOURCE

         Cloud SQL instance ID of the source.

      DESTINATION

         Cloud SQL instance ID of the clone.

FLAGS

      --async

         Do not wait for the operation to complete.

      --bin-log-file-name BIN_LOG_FILE_NAME

         Represents the position (offset) inside the binary log file created by
         the source instance if it has binary logs enabled. If specified, is the
         point up to which the source instance is cloned. It must be specified
         along with --bin-log-file to form a valid binary log coordinates. e.g.,
         123 (a numeric value)

      --bin-log-position BIN_LOG_POSITION

         Represents the name of the binary log file created by the source
         instance if it has binary logs enabled. If specified, is the point up
         to which the source instance is cloned. It must be specified along with
         --bin-log-position to form a valid binary log coordinates. e.g.,
         mysql-bin.000001

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      $gcloud sql instances clone myproject:instance-foo myproject:instance-bar
      OR

        $gcloud sql instances clone myproject:instance-foo
      myproject:instance-bar
              --bin-log-file mysql-bin.000020 --bin-log-position 170

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK sql component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
