NAME

      gcloud compute ssh - SSH into a virtual machine instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute ssh [USER@]INSTANCE [--command COMMAND]
         [--container CONTAINER] [--dry-run] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--plain] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--ssh-flag SSH_FLAG]
         [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute ssh is a thin wrapper around the ssh(1) command that takes
      care of authentication and the translation of the instance name into an IP
      address.

      This command ensures that the user's public SSH key is present in the
      project's metadata. If the user does not have a public SSH key, one is
      generated using ssh-keygen(1).

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [USER@]INSTANCE

         Specifies the instance to SSH into.

         USER specifies the username with which to SSH. If omitted, $USER from
         the environment is selected.

FLAGS

      --command COMMAND

         A command to run on the virtual machine.

      --container CONTAINER

         The name of a container inside of the virtual machine instance to
         connect to. This only applies to virtual machines that are using a
         Google container virtual machine image. For more information, see
         https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers.

      --dry-run

         If provided, prints the command that would be run to standard out
         instead of executing it.

      --plain

         Suppresses the automatic addition of ssh(1)/scp(1) flags. This flag is
         useful if you want to take care of authentication yourself or re-enable
         strict host checking.

      --ssh-flag SSH_FLAG

         Additional flags to be passed to ssh(1). It is recommended that flags
         be passed using an assignment operator and quotes. This flag will
         replace occurences of %USER% and %INSTANCE% with their dereferenced
         values. Example:

           $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a \
               --ssh-flag="-vvv" --ssh-flag="-L 80:%INSTANCE%:80"

         is equivalent to passing the flags --vvv and -L 80:162.222.181.197:80
         to ssh(1) if the external IP address of 'example-instance' is
         162.222.181.197.

      --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE

         The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
         ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to connect to. If not specified, you will be
         prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To SSH into 'example-instance' in zone us-central1-a, run:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a

      You can also run a command on the virtual machine. For example, to get a
      snapshot of the guest's process tree, run:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a \
            --command "ps -ejH"

      If you are using the Google container virtual machine image, you can SSH
      into one of your containers with:

        $ gcloud compute ssh example-instance --zone us-central1-a \
            --container CONTAINER

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
