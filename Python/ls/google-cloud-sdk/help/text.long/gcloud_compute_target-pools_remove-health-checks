SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-pools remove-health-checks NAME [--format FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-pools remove-health-checks is used to remove an HTTP
      health check from a target pool. Health checks are used to determine the
      health status of instances in the target pool. For more information on
      health checks and load balancing, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target pool from which to remove the health check.

FLAGS

      --http-health-check HEALTH_CHECK

         Specifies an HTTP health check object to remove from the target pool.

      --region REGION

         The region of the target pool to remove health checks from. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/region property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/region REGION

         A list of regions can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute regions list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/region

         Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
