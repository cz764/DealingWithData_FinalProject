NAME

      gcloud compute instances - read and manipulate Google Compute Engine
         virtual machine instances

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances COMMAND [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      Read and manipulate Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
