NAME

      gcloud compute target-instances create - create a target instance for
         handling traffic from a forwarding rule

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute target-instances create NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] --instance INSTANCE [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--quiet, -q] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute target-instances create is used to create a target instance
      for handling traffic from one or more forwarding rules. Target instances
      are ideal for traffic that should be managed by a single source. For more
      information on target instances, see
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/protocol-forwarding/#targetinstances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the target instance.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description of the target instance.

      --instance INSTANCE

         The name of the virtual machine instance that will handle the traffic.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to to create the target instance in. If not
         specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
