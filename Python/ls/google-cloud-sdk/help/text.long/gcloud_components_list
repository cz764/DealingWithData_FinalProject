NAME

      gcloud components list - list the status of all Cloud SDK components

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components list [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--quiet, -q] [--show-versions] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This command lists all the tools in the Cloud SDK (both individual
      components and preconfigured packages of components). For each component,
      the command lists the following information:

      o Status on your local workstation: not installed, installed (and
        up to date), and update available (installed, but not up to date)
      o Name of the component (a description)
      o ID of the component (used to refer to the component in other
        [gcloud components] commands)
      o Size of the component

      In addition, if the --show-versions flag is specified, the command lists
      the currently installed version (if any) and the latest available version
      of each individual component.

FLAGS

      --show-versions

         Show installed and available versions of all components.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      $ gcloud components list

      $ gcloud components list --show-versions

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
