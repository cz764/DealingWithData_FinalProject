DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instance-templates create facilitates the creation of
      Google Compute Engine virtual machine instance templates. For example,
      running:

        $ gcloud compute instance-templates create INSTANCE-TEMPLATE

      will create one instance templates called 'INSTANCE-TEMPLATE'.

      Instance templates are global resources, and can be used to create
      instances in any zone.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the instance template to create.

FLAGS

      --address ADDRESS

         Assigns the given external IP address to the instance that is created.
         This option can only be used when creating a single instance.

      --boot-disk-device-name BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME

         The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk as. This
         option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being created (as
         opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

      --boot-disk-size BOOT_DISK_SIZE

         The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
         boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
         persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a size
         unit of KB for kilobyte, MB for megabyte, GB for gigabyte, or TB for
         terabyte. For example, 10GB will produce a 10 gigabyte disk. If
         omitted, a default size of 200 GB is used. The minimum size a boot disk
         can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a multiple of 1 GB.

      --boot-disk-type BOOT_DISK_TYPE

         The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a new
         boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
         persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run $ gcloud
         compute disk-types list.

      --can-ip-forward

         If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
         non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

      --description DESCRIPTION

         Specifies a textual description for the instance template.

      --disk PROPERTY=VALUE [PROPERTY=VALUE ...]

         Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified must
         already exist.

         name

            The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than one
            instance and using this property, the only valid mode for attaching
            the disk is read-only (see mode below).

         mode

            Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for
            read-only and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a
            default. It is an error for mode to be rw when creating more than
            one instance because read-write disks can only be attached to a
            single instance.

         boot

            If yes, indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machines
            will use the first partition of the disk for their root file
            systems. The default value for this is no.

         device-name

            An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
            system will see. If omitted, a device name of the form
            persistent-disk-N will be used.

         auto-delete

            If yes, this persistent disk will be automatically deleted when the
            instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later detached from the
            instance, this option won't apply. The default value for this is no.

      --image IMAGE | centos-6 | centos-7 | container-vm | coreos | debian-7 |
         debian-7-backports | opensuse-13 | rhel-6 | rhel-7 | sles-11 |
         ubuntu-12-04 | ubuntu-14-04 | ubuntu-14-10 | windows-2008-r2

         Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a new
         boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk will
         have the same name as the instance.

         The value for this option can be the name of an image or an alias from
         the table below.

           Alias               Project             Image Name
           centos-6            centos-cloud        centos-6
           centos-7            centos-cloud        centos-7
           container-vm        google-containers   container-vm
           coreos              coreos-cloud        coreos-stable
           debian-7            debian-cloud        debian-7-wheezy
           debian-7-backports  debian-cloud        backports-debian-7-wheezy
           opensuse-13         opensuse-cloud      opensuse-13
           rhel-6              rhel-cloud          rhel-6
           rhel-7              rhel-cloud          rhel-7
           sles-11             suse-cloud          sles-11
           ubuntu-12-04        ubuntu-os-cloud     ubuntu-1204-precise
           ubuntu-14-04        ubuntu-os-cloud     ubuntu-1404-trusty
           ubuntu-14-10        ubuntu-os-cloud     ubuntu-1410-utopic
           windows-2008-r2     windows-cloud       windows-server-2008-r2

         When the value is an alias, this tool will query the public image
         project that contains the image type to find the latest image matching
         the alias. The user's project is also queried for an image with the
         same name as the alias. If a conflict exists, the user will be prompted
         to resolve the conflict.

         To specify an image in another project for which there is no alias, use
         --image-project. When --image-project is present, no API calls are made
         to resolve the image. This property is useful for scripts.

         When using this option, --boot-disk-device-name and --boot-disk-size
         can be used to override the boot disk's device name and size,
         respectively.

         By default, debian-7-backports is assumed for this flag.

      --image-project IMAGE_PROJECT

         The project against which all image references will be resolved. See
         --image for more details.

      --machine-type MACHINE_TYPE; default="n1-standard-1"

         Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
         available machine types, run 'gcloud compute machine-types list'.

      --maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY

         Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
         undergo maintenance. TERMINATE indicates that the instances should be
         terminated. MIGRATE indicates that the instances should be migrated to
         a new host. Choosing MIGRATE will temporarily impact the performance of
         instances during a migration event. If omitted, MIGRATE is assumed.

      --metadata KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]

         Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running on
         the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated by an
         equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128 bytes in
         length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes in length.
         Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g., --metadata
         key-1=value-1 key-2=value-2 key-3=value-3.

         In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, the
         following metadata keys have special meanings:

         startup-script

            Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once they
            start running. For convenience, --metadata-from-file can be used to
            pull the value from a file.

         startup-script-url

            Same as startup-script except that the script contents are pulled
            from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

      --metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH [KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH ...]

         Same as --metadata except that the value for the entry will be read
         from a local file. This is useful for values that are too large such as
         startup-script contents.

      --network NETWORK; default="default"

         Specifies the network that the instances will be part of. If omitted,
         the default network is used.

      --no-address

         If provided, the instances will not be assigned external IP addresses.

      --no-boot-disk-auto-delete

         If provided, boot disks will not be automatically deleted when their
         instances are deleted.

      --no-restart-on-failure

         If provided, the instances will not be restarted if they are terminated
         by Compute Engine. By default, failed instances will be restarted. This
         does not affect terminations performed by the user.

      --no-scopes

         If provided, the default scopes
         (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only) are not added to
         the instances.

      --scopes [ACCOUNT=]SCOPE [[ACCOUNT=]SCOPE ...]

         Specifies service accounts and scopes for the instances. Service
         accounts generate access tokens that can be accessed through the
         instance metadata server and used to authenticate applications on the
         instance. The account can be either an email address or an alias
         corresponding to a service account. If account is omitted, the
         project's default service account is used. The default service account
         can be specified explicitly by using the alias default. Example:

           $ gcloud compute instance-templates create example-instance \
               --scopes compute-rw me@project.gserviceaccount.com=storage-rw

         If this flag is not provided, the storage-ro scope is added to the
         instances. To create instances with no scopes, use --no-scopes:

           $ gcloud compute instance-templates create example-instance
         --no-scopes

         SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias. Available
         aliases are:

           Alias           URI
           bigquery        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery
           compute-ro      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly
           compute-rw      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute

           sql-admin       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin
           storage-full    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control
           storage-ro      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only
           storage-rw      https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write
           taskqueue       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/taskqueue
           userinfo-email  https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email

      --tags TAG [TAG ...]

         Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instances for identifying the
         instances to which network firewall rules will apply. See gcloud
         compute firewall-rules create(1) for more details.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
