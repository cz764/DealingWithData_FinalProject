NAME

      gcloud compute config-ssh - populate SSH config files with Host entries
         from each instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute config-ssh [--dry-run] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--remove]
         [--ssh-config-file SSH_CONFIG_FILE] [--ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute config-ssh makes SSHing to virtual machine instances easier
      by adding an alias for each instance to the user SSH configuration
      (~/.ssh/config) file.

      In most cases, it is sufficient to run:

        $ gcloud compute config-ssh

      Each instance will be given an alias of the form NAME.ZONE.PROJECT. For
      example, if example-instance resides in us-central1-a, you can SSH to it
      by running:

        $ ssh example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT

      On some platforms, the host alias can be tab-completed, making the long
      alias less daunting to type.

      The aliases created interface with SSH-based programs like scp(1), so it
      is possible to use the aliases elsewhere:

        $ scp ~/MY-FILE example-instance.us-central1-a.MY-PROJECT:~

      Whenever instances are added, removed, or their external IP addresses are
      changed, this command should be re-executed to update the configuration.

FLAGS

      --dry-run

         If provided, the proposed changes to the SSH config file are printed to
         standard out and no actual changes are made.

      --remove

         If provided, any changes made to the SSH config file by this tool are
         reverted.

      --ssh-config-file SSH_CONFIG_FILE

         Specifies an alternative per-user SSH configuration file. By default,
         this is ~/.ssh/config.

      --ssh-key-file SSH_KEY_FILE

         The path to the SSH key file. By default, this is
         ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK compute component. See installing
