NAME

      gcloud compute instances attach-disk - attach a disk to an instance

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute instances attach-disk INSTANCE [--device-name DEVICE_NAME]
         --disk DISK [--format FORMAT] [--help] [--mode MODE; default="rw"]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [--zone ZONE] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk to an
      instance. For example,

        $ gcloud compute instances attach-disk example-instance --disk DISK \
            --zone us-central1-a

      attaches the disk named 'DISK' to the instance named 'example-instance' in
      zone us-central1-a.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         The name of the instance to attach the disk to.

FLAGS

      --device-name DEVICE_NAME

         An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
         system will see.

      --disk DISK

         The name of the disk to attach to the instance.

      --mode MODE; default="rw"

         Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are ro for read-only
         and rw for read-write. If omitted, rw is used as a default. It is an
         error to attach a disk in read-write mode to more than one instance.

      --zone ZONE

         The zone of the instance to attach a disk to. If not specified, you
         will be prompted to select a zone.

         To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
         compute/zone property:

           $ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

         A list of zones can fetched by running:

           $ gcloud compute zones list

         To unset the property, run:

           $ gcloud config unset compute/zone

         Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
         CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.
