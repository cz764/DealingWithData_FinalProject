NAME

      gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule - add a rule to a URL map to map
         hosts to a path matcher

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule NAME [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT] [--help] --hosts HOSTS [HOSTS ...]
         --path-matcher-name PATH_MATCHER_NAME [--project PROJECT_ID]
         [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule is used to add a mapping of hosts to
      a patch matcher in a URL map. The mapping will match the host component of
      HTTP requests to path matchers which in turn map the request to a backend
      service. Before adding a host rule, at least one path matcher must exist
      in the URL map to take care of the path component of the requests. 'gcloud
      compute url-maps add-path-matcher' or 'gcloud compute url-maps edit' can
      be used to add path matchers.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      NAME

         The name of the URL map.

FLAGS

      --description DESCRIPTION

         An optional, textual description for the host rule.

      --hosts HOSTS [HOSTS ...]

         The set of hosts to match requests against. Each host must be a fully
         qualified domain name (FQDN) with the exception that the host can begin
         with a or -. * acts as a glob and will match any string of atoms to the
         left where an atom is separated by dots (.) or dashes (-).

      --path-matcher-name PATH_MATCHER_NAME

         The name of the patch matcher to use if a request matches this host
         rule. The patch matcher must already exist in the URL map (see 'gcloud
         compute url-maps add-path-matcher').

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To create a host rule mapping the *-foo.google.com and google.com hosts to
      the www path matcher, run:

        $ gcloud compute url-maps add-host-rule MY-URL-MAP \
            --hosts *-foo.google.com google.com --path-matcher-name www
