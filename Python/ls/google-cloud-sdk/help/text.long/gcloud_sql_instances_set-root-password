POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      INSTANCE

         Cloud SQL instance ID.

FLAGS

      --async

         Do not wait for the operation to complete.

      --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD

         The password for the root user. WARNING: Setting password using this
         option can potentially expose the password to other users of this
         machine. Instead, you can use --password-file to get the password from
         a file.

      --password-file PASSWORD_FILE

         The path to the filename which has the password to be set. The first
         line of the file will be interpreted as the password to be set.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK sql component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
