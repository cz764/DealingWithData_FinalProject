NAME

      gcloud compute operations list - list operations

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud compute operations list [NAME ...] [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--limit LIMIT] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q]
         [--regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP] [--sort-by SORT_BY] [--uri] [--global |
          --regions [REGION ...] | --zones [ZONE ...]] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      gcloud compute operations list lists summary information of operations in
      a project. The --uri option can be used to display URIs instead. Users who
      want to see more data should use 'gcloud compute operations describe'.

      By default, global operations and operations from all regions are listed.
      The results can be narrowed down by providing the --zones, --regions, or
      --global flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      [NAME ...]

         If provided, show details for the specified names and/or URIs of
         resources.

FLAGS

      --global

         If provided, only global resources are shown.

      --limit LIMIT

         The maximum number of results.

      --regexp REGEXP, -r REGEXP

         A regular expression to filter the names of the results on. Any names
         that do not match the entire regular expression will be filtered out.

      --regions [REGION ...]

         If provided, only regional resources are shown. If arguments are
         provided, only resources from the given regions are shown.

      --sort-by SORT_BY

         A field to sort by. To perform a descending-order sort, prefix the
         value of this flag with a tilde (~).

      --uri

         If provided, the list command will only print URIs for the resources
         returned. If this flag is not provided, the list command will print a
         human-readable table of useful resource data.

      --zones [ZONE ...]

         If provided, only zonal resources are shown. If arguments are provided,
         only resources from the given zones are shown.

GLOBAL FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES

      To list all operations in a project in table form, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list

      To list the URIs of all operations in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --uri

      To list all of the global operations in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --global

      To list all of the regional operations in a project, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --regions

      To list all of the operations from the us-central1 and the europe-west1
      regions, run:

        $ gcloud compute operations list --regions us-central1 europe-west1
