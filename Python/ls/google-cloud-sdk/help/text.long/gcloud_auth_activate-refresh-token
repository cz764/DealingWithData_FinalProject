NAME

      gcloud auth activate-refresh-token - get credentials via an existing
         refresh token

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud auth activate-refresh-token ACCOUNT [TOKEN] [--format FORMAT]
         [--help] [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      Use an oauth2 refresh token to manufacture credentials for Google APIs.
      This token must have been acquired via some legitimate means to work. The
      account provided is only used locally to help the Cloud SDK keep track of
      the new credentials, so you can activate, list, and revoke the credentials
      in the future.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS

      ACCOUNT

         The account to associate with the refresh token.

      [TOKEN]

         OAuth2 refresh token. If blank, prompt for value.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
