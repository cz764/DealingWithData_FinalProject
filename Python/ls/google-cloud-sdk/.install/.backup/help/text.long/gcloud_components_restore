NAME

      gcloud components restore - restore the Cloud SDK installation to its
         previous state

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components restore [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      This is an undo operation, which restores the Cloud SDK installation on
      the local workstation to the state it was in just before the most recent
      gcloud components update or gcloud components remove command. Only the
      state before the most recent such state is remembered, so it is impossible
      to restore the state that existed before the two most recent update
      commands, for example. A restore command does not undo a previous restore
      command.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
