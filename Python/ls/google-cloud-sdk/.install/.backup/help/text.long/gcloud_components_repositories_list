NAME

      gcloud components repositories list - list any Trusted Tester component
         repositories you have registered

SYNOPSIS

      gcloud components repositories list [--format FORMAT] [--help]
         [--project PROJECT_ID] [--quiet, -q] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

      List all Trusted Tester component repositories that are registered with
      the component manager. If you have additional repositories, the component
      manager will look at them to discover additional components to install, or
      different versions of existing components that are available.

FLAGS

      --format FORMAT

         Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
         human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of the
         available options will serialize the result of the command in the
         chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are: json,
         text, yaml.

      --help

         Display detailed help.

      --project PROJECT_ID

         The Google Cloud Platform project name to use for this invocation. If
         omitted then the current project is assumed.

      --quiet, -q

         Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
         is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.

      -h

         Print a summary help and exit.

NOTES

      This command is in the Google Cloud SDK core component. See installing
      components if it is not installed.
