gcloud\ components\ repositories\ \fICOMMAND\fR [\fB\-\-format\fR\ \fIFORMAT\fR] [\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-\-project\fR\ \fIPROJECT_ID\fR] [\fB\-\-quiet\fR,\ \fB\-q\fR] [\fB\-h\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
List, add, and remove component repositories for Trusted Tester programs\&. If you are not participating in a Trusted Tester program, these commands are not necessary for updating your Cloud SDK installation\&.
.sp
If you are participating in a Trusted Tester program, you will be instructed on the location of repositories that you should add\&. These commands allow you to manage the set of repositories you have registered\&.
.sp
Once you have a repository registered, the component manager will use that location to locate new Cloud SDK components that are available, or possibly different versions of existing components that can be installed\&.
.sp
If you want to revert to a standard version of the Cloud SDK at any time, you may remove all repositories and then run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ gcloud components update
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
to revert to a standard installation\&.
